\section{Production Order Release in SAP S/4HANA}
The release of a production order marks the transition from planning to execution in manufacturing. Before release, supervisors must ensure component availability and machine capacity. In SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud, these validations are often performed manually across multiple applications, which is time-consuming and error-prone. Current systems assume the BOM is complete and up to dateâ€”an assumption that rarely holds in practice \cite{sapprodrelease2025}.

\section{SAP Joule}
Joule is SAP's generative AI copilot that provides natural language interfaces and decision recommendations across enterprise domains \cite{sapjoule2025}. In manufacturing, Joule can be extended with custom functions that access transactional data through OData APIs. These \emph{Joule Functions} enable developers to implement domain-specific logic, such as retrieving stock levels or proposing alternative materials.

\section{SAP Agent Builder}
The SAP Agent Builder \cite{sapagentbuilder2025} framework allows the creation and orchestration of AI agents within the SAP ecosystem. Agents can encapsulate business logic, interact with core S/4HANA modules, and cooperate with Joule to deliver contextual recommendations. In manufacturing, Agent Builder offers a structured way to automate repetitive tasks such as production order release checks while ensuring compliance with enterprise security standards. For this project, it serves as the foundation for developing an AI-powered Production Order Release Agent.
