This project explores the automation of production order release in SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud Edition through an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered agent. Today, supervisors manually check material availability, production capacity, and scheduling across multiple applications, which is slow and error-prone. A major challenge is that Bills of Materials (BOMs) are often incomplete, preventing systems from suggesting alternatives when components are missing.  

We extend the Production Order Release Agent with the capability to recommend substitute components. By integrating Joule Functions with OData Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), the agent can detect shortages, propose alternatives from stock or BOM data, and recommend rescheduling if no substitutes exist.  

Evaluation indicates that the extended agent reduces manual effort, increases release reliability, and minimizes production downtime. The results highlight how AI agents can improve manufacturing execution in SAP S/4HANA and serve as a practical step toward intelligent, automated production planning.
